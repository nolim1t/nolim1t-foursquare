My personal foursquare API library
====================

About
---------------
This is my own personal foursquare API library. Use at your own risk.

It's probably quite unstructured, but I'm putting it up on version control and as an NPM module.

Installing
---------------
npm install nolim1t-foursquare

Example Usage
---------------
Mostly coming soon

But use 

```node.js
require("nolim1t-foursquare").functionname "parameters", callback
```
